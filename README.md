## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library - `Play CDN` version

### What I learned

In this project, I learned to gain familiarity working with Tailwind CSS. It's a lot of fun using Tailwind compared to the traditional CSS stylesheet, e.g. 
* one does not need to go back and forth between two scripts
* no need to come up with the most creative class/id names

For example, in order to achieve the effect
```css
.myclass {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
One can just do
```html
<p class="font-bold">Some HTML code I'm proud of</p>
```

Moreover, I think I am more comfortable with plotting out the basic structure/components of the design first, and then go about planning the design using the Tailwind CSS classes. (For example, check the `index.html` script, where I used `id` to indicate what the structure/layer of the current component is.)

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Official Doc](https://tailwindcss.com/) - it's a good resource for reference: do a quick search on CSS tags to get the corresponding Tailwind classes.
